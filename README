---

a scripting language which, alongside css, compiles into rainmeter ini files.

USAGE
---

you will need:
->  node.js
!   tested with node.js v16.15.0 (lts)
    you can check with `node -v` in cmd

->  rainmeter
!   tested with rainmeter v4.5.13
    you can check with right-click tray icon > About

~>  git
!   optional
    used to update repositories in @Sources and syren itself

steps:
1)  install syren (git clone into My Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\)
*   alternatively download repository as .zip and extract syren\ into Skins\

2)  cd @Resources

3)  compile.bat
*   this will make @Sources\ in the syren\ folder
*   this is where you place all your .syren and .css files, they are included
    in to your compilation automagically when running the compiler

ARCHITECTURE
---

the main folder which contains the source code for all your syren applications
is Skins\syren\@Sources. the "compiler" will include all files ending in .css
and .syren in this folder and its subfolders in the 'compilation'.

i put compiler in quotes as it is not much of a compiler. instead it is more of
a preprocessor. it runs in the following steps:

1.  interpret all the scripts
*   all the scripts (.syren files) will be ran in order of global1st.syren, to
    all other .syren files in alphabetical order, to global2nd.syren

2. application, meter, and measure objects are extracted from the closed runtime

3. parse all css files, and apply properties to the extracted objects

4. serialize all the objects into .ini files of their corrosponding application
